                    <p>If you are a fresh graduate - or new to IT - looking for the next job, you need to read this 
                        The last couple of years zekeLabs gave me a unique opportunity to assess technology demand in the industry and also to evaluate available talent pool for the demand.
                        Our consulting and technology training assignments for our corporate partners enlightened us on the technology skill in demand.

                    <p>DevOps is a paradigm shift in the way how software products are being built in the modern day Information Technology (IT) organizations. It is becoming the de-facto component in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process in most of the organizations.
                        But what is this all about. Here, I am exploring how DevOps can be compared to some of the similar revolutions of the past and how it is impacting the work culture in the organizations.

                    <p>To me Data Science can be encapsulated in a simple statement, it helps organizations and individuals to solve complex problems while minimizing human effort. There are several different aspects to this, which we shall go into later.
                        Here I have tried to answer some of the frequently asked questions by friends and juniors planning to switch their profiles and roles in the areas of Business Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.      
                        Hopefully,

                    <h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Day - Bangalore</h2>
                    <p><span>Arman Ahmed</span>&nbsp;| 05 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p>It was indeed a hectic day with back to back session sandwiched by good food and tea (on a lighter note, need to investigate the tactics behind the 5-star hotels keeping the plates so heavy. :D)
                        To me, AWS cloud day gave a lot of insights into the Business I am into -  Consulting & Training for Cloud & DevOps, and I could comprehend from the various sessions I attended, the way AWS and its business partners are moving.

                    <h2>edYoda Meetup #01 : A Date with Cloud</h2>
                    <p><span>Arman Ahmed</span>&nbsp;| 05 Jul 2019</p>
                    <p>As a trainer on Cloud and DevOps technologies when I enumerate the features of the cloud to someone from non-cloud background there seems to be a conflict of interest and bias.
                        As a matter of fact, sometimes we do get biased towards cloud services and see only the greener side of it. To do some reality check for us, as well as for other cloud practitioners we at edYoda planned a Tech Meetup on cloud services. The meetup was organized on 22nd April at our own office.
